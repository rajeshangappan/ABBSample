Offline Sync: (Background Sync.cs will take care)

- For Offline we majorly used the below columns in SQLite
  - **Version** – Using this, we will sync the data and override the new data to both offline and online.
  - **UpdatatedAt** – Using this column we will override the latest data to both offline and online
  - **IsDeleted** (soft delete)– Using this column will manage the deleted data in both offline and online.
